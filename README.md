# Ball Rolling Game - Unity 3D Project
This project is a 3D rolling ball game developed as part of a technical task to demonstrate fundamental game development skills in Unity and C#.

## Key Features
**Player Controller:** A custom script handling the physics-based movement and rolling of the ball.

**Jump Mechanics:** Integrated jump functionality triggered by a UI button and managed via BallController.cs.

**Win Zone Detection:** A hidden win-zone using a Trigger system to detect when the player completes the level.

## Technical Implementation
**Programming Language:** C#

**Game Engine:** Unity

**Physics:** Used Rigidbody for realistic movement and collisions.

**Camera System:** Implemented a public Transform target and Vector3 offset for flexible camera positioning.

## Project Structure
**Assets/Scripts:** Contains BallController.cs WinZone.cs.

**Assets/Scenes:** The main game environment.

**ProjectSettings:** Configuration files for input and physics.
